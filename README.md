## Introduction

This repository contains instructions for reproducing the analysis from our research manuscript in progress, which describes characterization of scFv antibody fragments selected through phage display against viral and control epitopes.

## Important Note on Licences

While this repository is released under the MIT License, the analysis described here relies on a Docker image that includes a version of [seq2scfv](https://github.com/ngs-ai-org/seq2scfv). That software is licensed by its original authors under a **Limited Use License**, restricting its use to **private, non-profit research purposes only**.
